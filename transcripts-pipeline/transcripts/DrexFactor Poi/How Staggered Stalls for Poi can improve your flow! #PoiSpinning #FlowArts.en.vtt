So<00:00:00.560><c> context,</c><00:00:01.360><c> staggered</c><00:00:01.920><c> stalls</c><00:00:02.399><c> are</c>

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 align:start position:0%
So context, staggered stalls are
 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.829 align:start position:0%
So context, staggered stalls are
something<00:00:03.040><c> that</c><00:00:03.439><c> I</c><00:00:03.760><c> picked</c><00:00:04.000><c> up</c><00:00:04.560><c> from</c><00:00:04.880><c> Ivan</c><00:00:05.440><c> Mel</c>

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
something that I picked up from Ivan Mel
 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.430 align:start position:0%
something that I picked up from Ivan Mel
Gorbinoff.<00:00:06.560><c> I</c><00:00:06.720><c> thought</c><00:00:06.879><c> that</c><00:00:07.040><c> they</c><00:00:07.279><c> were</c>

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
Gorbinoff. I thought that they were
 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.070 align:start position:0%
Gorbinoff. I thought that they were
fantastic<00:00:08.240><c> and</c><00:00:08.480><c> I</c><00:00:08.720><c> also</c><00:00:09.040><c> realized</c><00:00:09.599><c> that</c><00:00:09.840><c> they</c>

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
fantastic and I also realized that they
 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.910 align:start position:0%
fantastic and I also realized that they
were<00:00:10.320><c> connected</c><00:00:10.719><c> to</c><00:00:10.960><c> his</c><00:00:11.280><c> horizontal</c>

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
were connected to his horizontal
 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.230 align:start position:0%
were connected to his horizontal
stacking.<00:00:12.559><c> So</c><00:00:12.960><c> I</c><00:00:13.200><c> figured</c><00:00:13.440><c> it</c><00:00:13.679><c> was</c><00:00:13.759><c> useful</c><00:00:14.080><c> to</c>

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
stacking. So I figured it was useful to
 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.150 align:start position:0%
stacking. So I figured it was useful to
learn<00:00:14.480><c> how</c><00:00:14.639><c> to</c><00:00:14.719><c> do</c><00:00:14.880><c> both.</c><00:00:15.519><c> And</c><00:00:15.679><c> ever</c><00:00:15.920><c> since</c>

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
learn how to do both. And ever since
 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.510 align:start position:0%
learn how to do both. And ever since
then,<00:00:16.480><c> I've</c><00:00:16.640><c> been</c><00:00:16.800><c> performing</c><00:00:17.279><c> those</c>

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
then, I've been performing those
 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.550 align:start position:0%
then, I've been performing those
staggered<00:00:18.000><c> stalls,</c><00:00:18.800><c> not</c><00:00:19.119><c> just</c><00:00:19.439><c> as</c><00:00:20.080><c> kind</c><00:00:20.240><c> of</c><00:00:20.320><c> a</c>

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
staggered stalls, not just as kind of a
 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.390 align:start position:0%
staggered stalls, not just as kind of a
cool<00:00:20.800><c> little</c><00:00:21.039><c> fill</c><00:00:21.279><c> in</c><00:00:21.520><c> between</c><00:00:21.840><c> tricks,</c><00:00:22.160><c> but</c>

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
cool little fill in between tricks, but
 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.070 align:start position:0%
cool little fill in between tricks, but
also<00:00:22.640><c> as</c><00:00:22.880><c> a</c><00:00:23.039><c> great</c><00:00:23.279><c> way</c><00:00:23.439><c> to</c><00:00:23.600><c> accompany</c>

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
also as a great way to accompany
