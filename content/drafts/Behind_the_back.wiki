'''Behind the back''' ('''BTB''') refers to any [[flow arts]] technique performed with the props moving behind the performer's body. Behind-the-back moves are common across [[poi]], [[Staff (flow arts)|staff]], and other props.

== In poi ==

Behind-the-back poi involves spinning one or both poi behind the body. Common BTB poi techniques include:

* '''BTB [[weave]]''': The standard weave pattern performed behind the back
* '''BTB [[butterfly (flow arts)|butterfly]]''': Both poi on one side, behind the body
* '''BTB [[buzzsaw]]''': Split-time same-direction behind the body
* '''BTB extensions''': [[Extension (flow arts)|Extension]] patterns behind the back

Behind-the-back patterns are often combined with in-front patterns, with [[Transition (flow arts)|transitions]] moving the pattern from front to back and vice versa.

== In staff ==

Staff behind-the-back work includes passing the staff behind the body during spins, and performing full rotational patterns in the space behind the performer.
