'''Fire safety''' in [[flow arts]] refers to the practices, equipment, and protocols used to minimize risk during [[fire spinning]] performance and practice.

== Fuels ==

Different fuels have different properties relevant to fire spinning:

{| class="wikitable"
! Fuel !! Flash point !! Burn characteristics !! Notes
|-
| '''White gas''' (naphtha/Coleman fuel) || -43 C || Bright flame, fast burn, low smoke || Most common fire spinning fuel. Highly volatile.
|-
| '''Ultra-pure lamp oil''' || 61+ C || Moderate flame, slower burn, minimal smoke || Higher flash point makes fueling safer. Preferred by many performers.
|-
| '''Kerosene''' || 38-72 C || Yellow/orange flame, long burn, smoky || Longer burn time but messier. Not preferred for most uses.
|-
| '''Isopropyl alcohol''' || 12 C || Blue flame (nearly invisible), fast burn || Used for body burning. Burns at lower temperature. Difficult to see.
|}

'''Fuels to avoid:''' Gasoline (extremely volatile, toxic), ethanol/drinking alcohol (blue flame hard to see, burns unevenly), lighter fluid (unpredictable).

== Safety equipment ==

Minimum safety equipment for a fire spinning session:

* '''Fire blanket''' or '''wet towel''': For smothering flames on a person
* '''Fire extinguisher''': Rated for the fuel type being used
* '''First aid kit''': Including burn treatment supplies
* '''Spin-off towel''': A damp towel used to remove excess fuel from wicks before lighting
* '''Fuel dump bucket''': A container for submerging wicks to fuel them, with a sealable lid

== Safety roles ==

* '''Safety person''' (also "safety" or "spotter"): A designated sober person equipped with a wet towel or fire blanket who watches the performer and is prepared to act if something catches fire. Every fire spinning session should have at least one safety.
* '''Fuel attendant''': The person managing the fueling station. Should be separate from the performer and safety if possible.

== Safety protocols ==

=== Before spinning ===

* Check the area for flammable materials (dry grass, low branches, synthetic fabrics)
* Ensure adequate distance from spectators and structures
* Fuel wicks away from the spinning area
* Spin off excess fuel into a spin-off towel or bucket before lighting
* Wear appropriate clothing: natural fibers (cotton, wool), avoid synthetics that can melt
* Tie back loose hair
* Remove dangling jewelry or accessories

=== During spinning ===

* Safety person maintains line-of-sight to the performer at all times
* If wicks drip burning fuel, move away from the drops
* If clothing or hair catches fire: stop, drop, and the safety person applies the wet towel or blanket
* Communication signals between performer and safety should be established in advance

=== After spinning ===

* Extinguish wicks by suffocating with a damp towel (do not blow or wave)
* Allow wicks to cool before handling or storing
* Secure fuel containers
* Inspect wicks for wear and damage

== Environment ==

* '''Indoor fire spinning''' requires high ceilings, non-flammable surroundings, good ventilation, and often venue permission or permits
* '''Outdoor fire spinning''' should account for wind (affects flame direction and fuel spray), dry conditions, and local fire regulations
* Many public parks and venues require permits for fire performance
