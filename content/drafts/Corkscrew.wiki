A '''corkscrew''' is a [[poi]] pattern where the poi travels in a helical path, spiraling up or down relative to the body. The visual effect resembles a corkscrew or spiral staircase.

== Description ==

In a corkscrew, the [[Plane (flow arts)|plane]] of the poi's rotation tilts progressively, so the poi traces a path that ascends or descends while spinning. This combines rotation in one plane with a gradual shift along a perpendicular axis.

Corkscrews involve [[plane bending]], as the spinning plane is not fixed but continuously rotating along a second axis.
