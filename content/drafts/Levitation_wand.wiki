A '''levitation wand''' (also called '''levi wand''' or '''wand''') is a [[flow arts]] prop consisting of a rod with a concealed fulcrum point, attached to the performer's hand by a thin thread or filament. The hidden connection creates the illusion that the wand floats independently in space.

Levitation wand technique relies heavily on [[Isolation (flow arts)|isolation]] principles. The wand appears to hover, orbit, and move independently of the performer's hands through subtle manipulation of the filament and precise body movement.
