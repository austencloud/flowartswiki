A '''windmill''' is a [[poi]] pattern performed in the wheel [[Plane (flow arts)|plane]] (the plane perpendicular to the performer's chest), where both poi spin in the same direction with the arms extended to the sides. The visual resembles a windmill's blades rotating.

== Description ==

In a windmill, the performer typically extends their arms to the sides, with each poi spinning in a vertical circle in the wheel plane. Both poi usually travel in the same direction (e.g., both forward or both backward from the audience's perspective).

Windmills are one of the fundamental poi patterns and are often among the first wheel-plane moves a beginner learns.

== Timing variations ==

* '''[[Same time]] windmill''': Both poi at the same point in their cycle (arms move symmetrically)
* '''[[Split time]] windmill''': Poi 180 degrees out of phase (one up while the other is down)
