'''Rope dart''' is a [[flow arts]] prop consisting of a weighted end (the dart) attached to a long rope. It is derived from the traditional Chinese martial arts weapon of the same name. The performer swings, wraps, and releases the dart in flowing patterns that combine elements of [[poi]], [[Wrap (flow arts)|wrapping]], and [[Toss (flow arts)|tossing]].

Rope dart is typically performed as a single prop rather than in pairs, which places it outside the scope of most two-prop theory frameworks ([[Vulcan Tech Gospel]], [[The Kinetic Alphabet]], etc.).
