'''Flow arts''' (also called '''object manipulation''' or '''prop spinning''') is a broad category of movement disciplines involving the manipulation of props in rhythmic, continuous patterns. Flow arts combine elements of dance, circus arts, and meditative practice.

== Props ==

Common flow arts props include:

* '''[[Poi]]''': Weighted objects on flexible cords, swung in circular patterns.
* '''[[Staff (flow arts)|Staff]]''': Long rod manipulated through spins, rolls, and contact techniques. Can be single or [[double staff]].
* '''[[Fire fans]]''': Rigid or folding fans, often with fire or LED elements.
* '''[[Hoops]]''': Circular rings manipulated on and around the body.
* '''[[Contact juggling]]''': Spheres rolled across the hands and body surface.
* '''Rope dart''': A weighted end on a rope, combining striking and wrapping movements.
* '''Levitation wand''': A rod with a concealed balance point creating the illusion of independent movement.
* '''Clubs''': Juggling clubs adapted for spinning manipulation.
* '''Buugeng''': S-shaped props creating optical illusions when spun.

== Theory ==

The flow arts community has developed multiple theoretical frameworks for understanding and classifying movement:

* '''[[Vulcan Tech Gospel]]''' (VTG): Classifies [[timing and direction]] relationships and [[Flower (flow arts)|pattern shapes]].
* '''[[Continuous Assembly Patterns]]''' (CAPs): Compositional technique for assembling pattern fragments into cycles.
* '''[[Transition Theory]]''': Describes how spinners move between pattern states.
* '''[[9-Square Theory]]''': Spatial grid for mapping movement and transitions.
* '''[[The Kinetic Alphabet]]''' (TKA): Letter-based notation system for two-handed manipulation.
* '''[[Trigonometric model (poi)|Trigonometric model]]''': Parametric equations describing all poi patterns.
* '''[[Driving style]]''': Taxonomy of eight fundamental movement categories.

== Culture ==

The flow arts community includes fire spinning, LED performance, and non-lit practice. Flow jams (informal gatherings for practicing together) are common. Fire performance requires specific safety protocols including fuel selection, spinning area requirements, and safety personnel.

Major gathering points for the community include festivals, regional burns, and online forums such as [[Home of Poi]].
