'''Dash''' in [[flow arts]] notation refers to a straight-line hand movement from one grid position to the diametrically opposite position (180 degrees across). The term is used in [[The Kinetic Alphabet]] (TKA) as one of four hand path types (static, shift, dash, hash).

Unlike a [[Plane (flow arts)|shift]] (which follows a curved arc along the grid perimeter), a dash travels in a straight line through the grid's interior. Because the path is straight rather than curved, the [[prospin|pro]]/[[antispin|anti]]/[[Float (flow arts)|float]] rotation distinctions do not apply to dashes. At 0 turns, the prop translates along the straight path without spinning. At higher turn counts, the prop rotates clockwise or counterclockwise during the traverse.

The term "slide" has sometimes been used in the community to refer to this type of straight-line hand movement, though "slide" is ambiguous (see [[Float (flow arts)#Disambiguation|Float: Slide disambiguation]]).

== In TKA ==

* '''Type 4''' letters (dash): One hand dashes, one stays static.
* '''Type 5''' letters (dual-dash): Both hands dash simultaneously.
* '''Type 3''' letters (cross-shift): One hand shifts while the other dashes.
