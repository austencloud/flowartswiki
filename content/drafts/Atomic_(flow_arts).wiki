In [[flow arts]] theory, '''atomic''' refers to a movement pattern where the two hands operate independently in different spatial domains: one hand traces a large circle while the other traces a smaller circle within or near it. The term is used in [[Lorq Nichols|Lorq Nichols']] [[Driving style|driving style]] taxonomy.

== Description ==

Atomic patterns involve asymmetric hand paths, where one poi traces a large orbit and the other traces a smaller orbit inside or adjacent to it. This creates a visual effect reminiscent of an electron orbiting a nucleus (hence the name).

The hands may be operating in the same [[Plane (flow arts)|plane]] or in different planes. The key characteristic is the difference in the radius of the two hand circles.

== As a driving style ==

In the [[Driving style|driving style]] framework developed by [[Lorq Nichols]] and Insignia, atomic is one of eight categories of [[poi]] movement. It is distinguished from [[Isolation (flow arts)|isolation]] (where the prop is stationary and the hand orbits) and from [[Extension (flow arts)|extension]] (where hand and prop travel together).
