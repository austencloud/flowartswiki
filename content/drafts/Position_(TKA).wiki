In [[The Kinetic Alphabet]] (TKA), a '''position''' describes the spatial configuration of both hands on the [[Grid (TKA)|grid]] at a specific moment. Positions are identified by Greek letters and numbered variants.

== Position names ==

{| class="wikitable"
! Position !! Description
|-
| '''Alpha''' || Hands in a configuration associated with [[split time]] patterns in the [[Vulcan Tech Gospel]]
|-
| '''Beta''' || Hands in a configuration associated with [[same time]] patterns
|-
| '''Gamma''' || A third hand configuration
|-
| '''Zeta''' || Fourth configuration
|-
| '''Eta''' || Fifth configuration
|-
| '''Tau''' || Sixth configuration
|-
| '''Terra''' || Seventh configuration
|}

Each position name has numbered variants (e.g., alpha1, alpha3, beta5, gamma11) that specify the exact [[Grid (TKA)|grid]] points occupied by the red (right) and blue (left) hands.

== Role in sequences ==

Positions serve as the start and end states for each TKA letter. A letter's starting position must match the previous letter's ending position for the sequence to be valid. This constraint governs which letters can follow which in a [[Compound (TKA)|compound]] or [[LOOP]].
