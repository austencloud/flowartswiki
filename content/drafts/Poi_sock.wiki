'''Poi socks''' (also '''sock poi''' or '''practice poi''') are a simple, inexpensive form of [[poi]] made by placing a weighted object (such as a tennis ball or rolled-up pair of socks) inside a long sock or fabric tube. Poi socks are the most common entry point for beginners learning to spin poi.

== Construction ==

A basic pair of poi socks requires:

* Two long socks (knee-high or tube socks)
* Two tennis balls, rolled socks, or other soft weights
* The weight is placed in the toe of the sock; the open end serves as the handle

== Advantages ==

* '''Low cost''': Can be made from household materials
* '''Safe''': Soft weight minimizes injury risk during learning
* '''Immediate''': No specialized equipment needed to start spinning

== Limitations ==

* Less visual than [[LED props]] or fire
* Tether length is not adjustable
* Weight and balance are inconsistent compared to purpose-built poi
* Fabric can be noisy when spinning fast

Poi socks are sometimes called "practice poi," though that term can also refer to purpose-built non-fire, non-LED poi designed for regular practice.
