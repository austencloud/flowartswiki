A '''whip''' in the [[flow arts]] context refers to the use of whips (typically signal whips, snake whips, or bullwhips) as a performance and manipulation prop. Whip cracking and flow combine precision technique with rhythm and body movement.

== Types ==

* '''Signal whip''': A short, single-piece whip (90-120 cm) commonly used in flow contexts. Compact and fast.
* '''Snake whip''': Similar to a signal whip but with a shot-loaded handle. Flexible from base to tip.
* '''Bullwhip''': Longer whip with a rigid handle. More theatrical but less agile.
* '''Fire whip''': A whip with a kevlar cracker that can be lit for [[fire spinning|fire performance]].

== Techniques ==

* '''Cracks''': The defining technique. The whip tip breaks the sound barrier, creating a sharp crack.
* '''Wraps''': Wrapping the whip around the body or limbs
* '''Routines''': Choreographed sequences of cracks, wraps, and body movement set to music
* '''Dual whips''': Performing with a whip in each hand
