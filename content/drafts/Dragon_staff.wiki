'''Dragon staff''' is a [[flow arts]] prop consisting of a central [[Staff (flow arts)|staff]] with radiating spokes that extend outward. The spokes create additional visual [[Plane (flow arts)|planes]] as the staff rotates, producing complex geometric patterns.

Dragon staff can be performed with fire wicks on the spoke tips or with LED elements. The spoke pattern creates a visual effect distinct from standard staff manipulation.
