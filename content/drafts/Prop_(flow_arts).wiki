In [[flow arts]], a '''prop''' is any physical object manipulated by a performer as part of their practice or performance. Props range from simple (a ball on a string) to complex (programmable LED systems).

== Categories ==

Flow arts props can be categorized by their manipulation type:

{| class="wikitable"
! Category !! Description !! Examples
|-
| '''Tethered''' || Prop connected to the hand by a string, chain, or cord || [[Poi]], [[rope dart]], [[meteor]]
|-
| '''Rigid''' || Solid prop held directly or balanced || [[Staff (flow arts)|Staff]], [[Hoops|hoops]], [[Fan (flow arts)|fans]], [[Clubs (flow arts)|clubs]]
|-
| '''Contact''' || Props manipulated through body contact without gripping || [[Contact juggling]], [[contact roll]]
|-
| '''Levitation''' || Props that appear to float independently of the body || [[Levitation wand]]
|-
| '''Hybrid''' || Props combining multiple manipulation types || [[Dragon staff]] (rigid + contact), [[buugeng]] (rigid + visual illusion)
|}

== Materials ==

Props are built for different performance contexts:

* '''Practice''': Durable, visible, safe for indoor use. Often silicone, plastic, or fabric.
* '''Fire''': Metal frames with [[wicking|kevlar wicks]]. See [[fire spinning]].
* '''LED/glow''': Built-in lights for nighttime performance. See [[LED props]].
* '''Performance''': Optimized for visual impact, balance, and handling.

== Customization ==

Many flow arts practitioners customize or build their own props. Common modifications include:

* Adjusting weight and balance
* Changing tether length (for poi and rope dart)
* Adding grips or handles
* Modifying LED programming
* Building custom fire wicks
