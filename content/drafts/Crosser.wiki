A '''crosser''' (also '''cross''' or '''crossing''') is a [[poi]] technique where the arms cross over each other during the spinning pattern. Crossers change the spatial relationship between the two poi and are a common element in [[weave]] patterns and transitions.

== Description ==

In a crosser, one arm passes in front of or behind the other, temporarily reversing the left-right positioning of the hands. The poi continue spinning during the cross. Crossers are a defining feature of the [[weave]] family of patterns: a standard 3-beat weave includes two crossers per cycle.

== Types ==

* '''Front cross''': Arms cross in front of the body (the standard crosser in most weave patterns)
* '''Behind-the-back cross''': Arms cross behind the body
* '''Over-the-head cross''': Arms cross above the head

== Relationship to other concepts ==

In [[Transition Theory]], crossers can function as transitions between spatial positions. In the [[Vulcan Tech Gospel]], crossers relate to the spatial position of the poi relative to the body center.
