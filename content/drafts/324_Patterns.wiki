'''324 Patterns''' is a classification framework for [[poi]] movement created by [[Lorq Nichols]]. It organizes patterns by multiplying 27 arm paths by 12 shapes across 3 [[Plane (flow arts)|planes]], producing 324 distinct patterns.<ref name="324">{{cite web |url=http://spinscience.xyz/324-patterns/ |title=324 Patterns |publisher=Spin Science}}</ref>

== Structure ==

=== 27 arm paths ===

The 27 arm paths derive from Nichols' arm path theory:

* 3 axes (vertical, horizontal, depth)
* 3 planes ([[Plane (flow arts)|wall, wheel, floor]])
* 3 positions per axis

This produces 9 arm positions, which combine into 27 arm path transitions.

=== 12 shapes ===

Four minimal-beat shapes, each performed in three planes:

* [[Extension (flow arts)|Extension]]
* [[Isolation (flow arts)|Isolation]]
* 2VA (2-beat vertical antispin)
* 2HA (2-beat horizontal antispin)

4 shapes x 3 planes = 12 shapes.

=== Total ===

27 arm paths x 12 shapes = 324 patterns.

Nichols also created the [[Shape Matrix|144 Atomic Hybrids]] catalog (12 shapes x 9 arm paths), with the principle that knowing a quarter of a pattern reveals the whole pattern.<ref name="144">{{cite web |url=https://sirlorq.wordpress.com/144ultimatepattern/ |title=144 Atomic Hybrids |publisher=Sir Lorq}}</ref>
