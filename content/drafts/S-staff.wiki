An '''S-staff''' is a [[flow arts]] prop consisting of a staff with a curved S-shaped profile. The curves add visual interest and change the manipulation characteristics compared to a straight [[Staff (flow arts)|staff]].

== Description ==

Unlike a standard straight staff, an S-staff has one or more gentle curves along its length. These curves create different visual lines when spun and allow for unique contact points during manipulation. The weight distribution of an S-staff differs from a straight staff, which changes how it responds to spins and rolls.

== Techniques ==

S-staff manipulation uses many of the same techniques as straight staff spinning, including:

* Spins and rotations
* [[Contact roll|Contact rolls]] along the body
* Isolations
* Tosses

The curved shape adds visual effects during spins: the curves create an undulating visual pattern that a straight staff cannot produce.
