'''Musicality''' in [[flow arts]] refers to the practice of synchronizing prop movement with music. A performer with strong musicality matches their patterns, transitions, and body movement to the rhythm, melody, dynamics, and structure of the music they are spinning to.

== Elements ==

* '''Rhythm matching''': Aligning the tempo of the spin to the beat of the music
* '''Accents''': Timing stalls, direction changes, or other visual punctuation to coincide with musical accents
* '''Phrasing''': Structuring sequences of patterns to match musical phrases (verse, chorus, bridge)
* '''Dynamics''': Varying speed, intensity, and spatial range in response to the music's dynamics (loud/soft, building/releasing)
* '''Genre interpretation''': Different musical genres lend themselves to different movement qualities

== In performance ==

Musicality is a primary distinguishing factor between technical practice and performance. A performer may know many patterns but without musicality the performance can feel disconnected. Conversely, a performer with fewer techniques but strong musicality can create a compelling show.

In competitive or judged contexts, musicality is typically one of the evaluation criteria alongside technical difficulty and creativity.
