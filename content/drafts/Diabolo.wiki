A '''diabolo''' is a manipulation prop consisting of a spool that is spun on a string tied between two hand sticks. The player accelerates the spool by moving the sticks and string, then performs tricks while maintaining the spin.

== Design ==

* '''Spool''': An hourglass or axle-shaped object, typically made of rubber or plastic. Ranges from beginner-friendly wide cups to performance-grade narrow axles.
* '''String''': A length of string tied between two hand sticks
* '''Hand sticks''': Two sticks (typically 30-40 cm) used to manipulate the string

== Techniques ==

* '''Power moves''': Accelerating the diabolo's spin
* '''Tosses''': Throwing the diabolo into the air and catching on the string
* '''Grinds''': Balancing the spinning diabolo on the string or stick
* '''Wraps''': Wrapping the string around the axle for tricks
* '''Multi-diabolo''': Running two or more diabolos on the same string simultaneously

== Relationship to flow arts ==

Diabolo has strong roots in [[juggling]] and circus arts. While not always classified as a [[flow arts]] prop, diabolo shares the flow arts community's emphasis on continuous movement, body expression, and creative manipulation. Some performers incorporate diabolo into flow arts contexts.
