'''Thread the needle''' is a [[flow arts]] technique in which a prop (typically [[poi]]) passes through a gap created by the performer's arms or between the arm and body. The move gets its name from the visual similarity to threading a needle.

== Description ==

The performer creates an opening (usually by extending one arm and creating a window between the arm and torso, or between both arms) and passes the poi through this gap. The move can be performed from various positions and incorporated into longer sequences.

== Variations ==

* '''Arm thread''': Poi passes through the gap between the arm and the body
* '''Over-under thread''': Poi passes over one arm and under the other
* '''Cross-body thread''': Poi passes through a gap created by crossed arms
* '''Moving thread''': Threading while transitioning between patterns
