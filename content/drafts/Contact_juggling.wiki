'''Contact juggling''' is a [[flow arts]] discipline where objects (typically spheres) are manipulated on the surface of the hands and body without being tossed into the air. The ball appears to float, roll, and glide across the performer's body through precise hand movements and balance.

Contact juggling [[Isolation (flow arts)|isolations]] are related to, but mechanically different from, poi isolations. In contact juggling, the ball maintains a fixed point through surface contact and balance. In poi, isolation is achieved through rotational mechanics (0-turn [[prospin|pro]]).

[[Lorq Nichols]] began his flow arts practice with contact juggling in 2000 before expanding into [[poi]] and other props.<ref name="lorq-about">{{cite web |url=https://sirlorq.wordpress.com/about-2/ |title=About |publisher=Sir Lorq}}</ref>
