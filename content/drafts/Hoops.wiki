'''Hoops''' (also called '''flow hoops''' or '''hula hoops''') are a [[flow arts]] prop consisting of a circular ring manipulated on and around the body. Hoop dance combines traditional hula hooping with flow arts technique, including [[Isolation (flow arts)|isolations]], body rolls, and off-body manipulation.

[[Cassie McKenney]] and Maiki Nope adapted the [[Vulcan Tech Gospel]] for hoops as "Hoop VTG 1:1," covering prop facing and grip shifts specific to the prop.<ref name="hoop-vtg">{{cite web |url=https://noelyee.com/hoop-vtg-11-with-cassie-mckenney/ |title=Hoop VTG 1:1 with Cassie McKenney |publisher=Noel Yee}}</ref>
