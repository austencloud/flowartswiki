The '''butterfly''' is a [[poi]] pattern in [[flow arts]] where both poi spin on the same side of the body in [[same time|together timing]]. The two poi trace parallel circles that visually resemble the wings of a butterfly.

The butterfly is a foundational pattern that introduces spinners to same-side, [[same time|together-time]] spinning. It is closely related to the [[buzzsaw]], which uses [[split time]] instead.
