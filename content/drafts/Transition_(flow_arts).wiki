A '''transition''' in [[flow arts]] is any movement that takes a performer from one pattern or technique to another. Transitions are a fundamental element of flow arts practice, connecting individual tricks into continuous sequences.

== Types of transitions ==

=== By mechanism ===

The [[Transition Theory]] framework, developed by [[Noel Yee]] and [[Jordan Campbell]], classifies transitions into categories based on what changes:

* '''Soft transitions''': The prop's timing or direction changes without a visible break in movement
* '''Hard transitions''': An abrupt change involving a stop, stall, or direction reversal
* '''Mixed transitions''': A combination of soft and hard elements

=== By what changes ===

Transitions can change one or more elements of the current pattern:

* '''[[Timing and direction]]''': Shifting between [[same time]], [[split time]], same direction, or opposite direction
* '''[[Plane (flow arts)|Plane]]''': Moving from wall plane to wheel plane, or other plane shifts
* '''Pattern type''': Moving from a [[weave]] to a [[butterfly (flow arts)|butterfly]], for example
* '''Body orientation''': Turning the body while maintaining prop momentum (see [[reel]])
* '''Handedness''': Switching which hand leads

=== Reversals ===

[[Reversal (flow arts)|Reversals]] are a specific category of transition where the direction of rotation changes. These can involve hand direction reversal, prop spin reversal, or both simultaneously.
