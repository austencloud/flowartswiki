'''Prop Logic''' is a [[flow arts]] educational project by [[Charlie Cushing]], focused on teaching poi theory and technique through a structured curriculum. Prop Logic offers online courses and in-person workshops covering fundamental through advanced poi concepts.<ref name="proplogic">{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/proplogic/ |title=Prop Logic |via=Instagram}}</ref>

== Approach ==

Prop Logic's teaching methodology integrates multiple theoretical frameworks including:

* [[9-Square Theory]] (developed by Cushing)
* [[QFT Notation]] (co-developed by Cushing)
* The [[Continuous Assembly Patterns|8-Step CAP]] recipe (co-developed by Cushing)

The curriculum emphasizes understanding the underlying structure of poi movement rather than learning tricks in isolation.
