A '''toss''' in [[flow arts]] is the act of releasing a prop into the air and catching it. Tosses add a vertical dimension to spinning and can be performed with virtually any prop type.

Toss techniques range from simple throw-and-catch patterns to complex sequences involving body turns, behind-the-back catches, and multi-prop tosses. In [[poi]], tosses can be integrated with [[Flower (flow arts)|flower]] patterns and [[Continuous Assembly Patterns|CAPs]].
