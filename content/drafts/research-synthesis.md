## The Theoretical Landscape

TKA exists within a rich ecosystem of flow arts theory frameworks developed primarily during 2007-2016. Understanding these systems is essential for engaging credibly with experienced spinners.

### Framework Overview

| System | Creator(s) | What it does | Output format |
|--------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **VTG** | Noel Yee, Jordan Campbell, David Cantor | Classifies timing/direction relationships + flower patterns | Categories (TS, TO, SS, SO) |
| **CAPs** | Alien Jon, community | Sequential assembly of pattern fragments into cycles | Conceptual framework + math notation |
| **9-Square Theory** | Charlie Cushing | Quantizes poi space into a spatial grid | Grid positions + transitions |
| **QFT Notation** | Charlie Cushing + Drex | Written shorthand for recording any poi movement | Formula: `a,b(h(+/-x+/-y+/-z)h'){Class}a',b'` |
| **Transition Theory** | Noel Yee + Jordan Campbell | How patterns connect to each other | Soft/hard/mixed transition types |
| **Shape Matrix** | Lorq Nichols | Multiplication table for tricks (L hand x R hand) | 8x8 visual grid |
| **P.H.A.T. Chart** | Lorq Nichols | 64 patterns organized in Tech Tiles | Color-coded 8x8 grid |
| **324 Patterns** | Lorq Nichols | 27 arm paths x 12 shapes | Comprehensive pattern catalog |
| **Trigonometric Model** | Drex (documenting Zaltymbunk) | Parametric equations for all poi patterns | `x = h*sin(t) + p*sin(dt)` |
| **Graph Theory** | Drex | Poi paths as planar graphs | Vertices (crosspoints) + edges |
| **TKA** | Austen Cloud | Alphabet for two-handed prop manipulation | Letters, words, sentences |

**What none of these produce:** readable, writable, speakable, drawable notation. TKA is the only system that functions as language.

## VTG (Vulcan Tech Gospel)

### Origin

Created at the **Vulcan Lofts** in Oakland, CA — a live/work space housing 50+ art studios. Core creators:
- **Noel Yee** — primary compiler and theorist, 11+ years teaching experience, board member of IJA
- **Jordan Campbell** — co-created Transition Theory (2010), which "settled the core dogma of VTG"
- **David "Tankboy" Cantor** — co-authored VTG Volume 2
- **Brian Thompson** — co-author, taught club spinning hybrids
- **Lorq Nichols** — created the Book of P.H.A.T. and Tech Tiles visualization system

### The VTG Trinity

Three interconnected concepts form the foundation:

**1. Timing and Direction** — the foundational layer
- **Together (tog):** Both props pass the downbeat (south/bottom) simultaneously
- **Split:** Props 180 degrees out of phase
- **Same:** Both props rotating the same way
- **Opposite:** Props rotating opposite ways

Four categories: TS (tog-same), TO (tog-opp), SS (split-same), SO (split-opp). Timing listed first, direction second.

**2. Snapshots (Prop Facing)** — what a pattern looks like at a specific moment
- Props described as "pointing in" (toward center) or "pointing out" (away from center)
- Captured at cardinal points (up/down/left/right axis crossings)

**3. Pattern (Shape)** — the flower shape traced over 360 degrees
- Categorized by prop-to-hand rotation ratios: 1:1, 1:3, 1:5
- 40 patterns in the 1:1 set, 64 in the 1:3 set (documented in Book of P.H.A.T.)

### Transition Theory

Created by Noel Yee and Jordan Campbell (2010). Describes standard ways to navigate between timing/direction combinations. Four transition types:

| Transition | Hand | Poi | Effect |
|-----------|------|-----|--------|
| **Soft** | Maintains direction | Maintains direction | Preserves figure character |
| **Hard** | Reverses | Reverses | Mirror image, opposite direction |
| **Mixed (C-CAP type)** | Reverses | Maintains | Reverses arc/loop character |
| **Mixed (other)** | Maintains | Reverses | Reverses arc/loop character |

**Arcs and Loops:**
- **Loops** = antispin/inspin petals, isolations (poi and hand paths intersect)
- **Arcs** = extensions (hand and poi move parallel, don't intersect)
- Mixed transitions convert arcs to loops and vice versa — this is the mechanism behind CAPs

### VTG Reference System

VTG is **ground-referenced** — the downbeat (south/bottom of circle) anchors all classification. This contrasts with TKA's **center-referenced** system.

### VTG Prop Agnosticism

VTG applies to all two-prop spinning: poi, double staff, fans, hoops, clubs, buugeng, triads. Specific adaptations exist for hoops (Cassie McKenney) and fans (Mike Smith "Doodle").

### VTG App

Available on iOS and Android (by Michael Pike and Noel Yee). Includes animations for 1:1 and 1:3 patterns, quiz modes, and multi-prop support (staff/poi/club/hoop/fan).

## CAPs (Continuous Assembly Patterns)

### The Three Definitions

CAP means different things to different people. Know which definition your conversation partner uses.

**Definition 1 — The Specific Technique (most common usage):**
The C-CAP: switching between extension and one petal of antispin by reversing arm direction every half circle. Hand reverses, poi doesn't. Traces a kidney-bean/heart shape. This is what most spinners mean when they say "CAP."

**Definition 2 — The C-CAP Family (expanded):**
Any two shapes combined with the C-CAP hand-reversal mechanism. Not limited to extension + antispin. Example: box antispin transitioning to 2-petal inspin.

**Definition 3 — The Original Concept (broadest):**
"Continuous Assembly Pattern" = ANY pattern that combines different stuff and repeats. 8-step CAPs, 40-step CAPs, whatever. If it's composite and cyclic, it's a CAP. As the community states: **"CAPs are not a move, they are a way of thinking about movement."**

This third definition is the one most conceptually similar to TKA LOOPs.

### Origin of the Term

Coined by **Damien (French_Saltimbanque)** on Home of Poi forums. Adopted and promoted by Alien Jon and the broader tech poi community. The alternative expansion "Capped Antispin Patterns" was popularized by **Nick Woolsey** (PlayPoi).

### The CAP vs Hybrid Distinction

This is fundamental:
- **Hybrids** = two different patterns performed **simultaneously** (one per hand). Spatial asymmetry.
- **CAPs** = two different patterns performed **sequentially** (by the same hand over time). Temporal asymmetry.

Same asymmetry, different dimension. Hybrids are "parallel information treatment." CAPs are "serial information treatment."

### CAP Mathematics (Zaltymbunk's System)

Elementary pattern notation: `Theta1 Theta2 ; Rho1 Rho2 ; d`
- **Theta1, Theta2** — harmonic frequencies (rotation counts)
- **Rho1, Rho2** — modulus components (radii/lengths)
- **d** — division factor (0 < d <= 1, fraction of full cycle used)

Pattern types:
- **Rosettes:** Rho1 = Rho2 (equal radii)
- **Cycloids:** hand and poi tip move at equal ground-frame speeds

CAP assembly: `Pattern A ; d1 & Pattern B ; d2`
Example: `1 0 ; 1 3/4 ; 1/2 & -1 4 ; 1 3/4 ; 1/2`

Feasibility rule: antispin patterns require `abs(Theta1) < abs(Theta2)`

### Trigonometric Model

All poi patterns described by parametric equations:
```
x = h*sin(t) + p*sin(dt)
y = h*cos(t) + p*cos(dt)
```
Where h = handpath radius, p = poi phasing, d = relative downbeats.
- Positive d = inspin, negative d = antispin
- Petal count = |1 - d|

This model is genuinely generative — plug in untried parameter values to discover new patterns.

### 8-Step CAP (Charlie Cushing)

Charlie's specific innovation. Solves the problem of awkward timing transitions.

**Principle:** "Two steps forward, one step back."
- Pattern 1 travels 3/4 circle in one direction
- Pattern 2 travels 1/2 circle in the opposite direction
- The distance mismatch cycles through both timing variations
- Performed in all four cardinal directions = 8 segments total

"There are literally hundreds of possible 8-step CAPs."

### CAPs and VTG Together

VTG provides the **classification system** (what patterns exist, how to transition between them). CAPs provide a **compositional technique** (take fragments of VTG-classified patterns and assemble them into new cycles). VTG is the grammar; CAPs are a sentence structure built from that grammar.

### Current State (2025-2026)

CAPs remain a core intermediate technique. The C-CAP is "a rite of passage for many poi spinners." The golden age of theory development (2008-2014) has passed — recent years focus more on performance aesthetics and community building than new theoretical frameworks.

## 9-Square Theory (Charlie Cushing)

Quantizes poi space into a grid around the body. Positions have origins, destinations, and purposes. Enables:
- Finding transitions between movements via grid positions
- Switching between box mode and diamond mode via soft transitions
- Creating algorithms for changing timing/direction through CAPs and polyrhythm hybrids
- Cross-discipline applications (tutting, Laban Movement Analysis)

10-part video series (~1.5 hours total). Recommends poi length of 1/2 arm length for optimal 9-square patterns.

---

## QFT (Quantized Field Theory) Notation

Written shorthand by Charlie Cushing. Breaks continuous poi motion into 8 discrete positions numbered 1-8 clockwise (1=up-right through 8=up).

Tracks per increment:
- Poi departure and arrival positions (1-8)
- Poi direction at each point
- Hand departure and arrival positions
- Hand path radius (in poi-length units)

Full formula: `a,b(h(+/-x+/-y+/-z)h'){Class}a',b'`

Can describe any poi pattern (static spin, extensions, flowers, isolations, cateyes, triquetras, CAPs). Technically complete but extremely specialized — requires training to read or write.

## Lorq Nichols / Spin Science Frameworks

### Shape Matrix
Multiplication table for tricks. Left-hand flower shapes x right-hand flower shapes. Went viral on Poi Chat in 2016 (353 shares). Originally created 2012, reworked 2014.

## How TKA Relates to All of This

### What TKA Shares With These Systems

| Shared Concept | VTG/CAP Term | TKA Term |
|---|---|---|
| Relative timing of two props | Together / Split | VTG timing preserved in TKA data |
| Relative direction | Same / Opposite | VTG direction preserved in TKA data |
| Grid-based spatial thinking | 9-Square Theory | TKA grid (diamond/box/skewed modes) |
| Position classification | 9-Square positions | Alpha, Beta, Gamma, etc. |
| Rotation types | Inspin/Antispin/Extension | Pro/Anti/Float/Static/Dash |
| Circular repeating patterns | CAPs | LOOPs |
| Pattern fragments assembled | CAP assembly | Compound letters (DJ, EK, FL) |

### What TKA Does That None of These Do

**TKA is the only system that produces language.** Every other system produces notation, formulas, charts, categories, or visual tools. TKA produces words.

| Capability | VTG | CAPs | 9-Square | QFT | TKA |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Say it out loud | No | No | No | No | **Yes** ("CAKE") |
| Write on a napkin | No | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Text to a friend | No | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Read without training | No | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Draw by hand | No | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| Teach to a 4-year-old | No | No | No | No | **Yes** (the letters) |

### What These Systems Do That TKA Doesn't (Yet)

- **Trigonometric modeling** — parametric equations for prop tip paths. TKA describes hand positions and rotation types, not the continuous curve the prop traces.
- **Graph theory analysis** — poi paths as planar graphs. TKA doesn't analyze topological properties of traced paths.
- **3D plane classification** — Wall/Wheel/Floor plane framework. TKA currently operates in 2D (through Level 7). Levels 8-9 (Atomics, Rubik's cube) will address this.
- **Prop tip path visualization** — the flower shapes, cycloid curves, rosette patterns. TKA visualizes hand positions and prop orientations, not the trailing path.

### The Fundamental Category Difference

VTG, CAPs, 9-Square, QFT, Shape Matrix, trigonometric models, graph theory — these are all **analysis tools**. They help practitioners and theorists understand, classify, and predict movement.

TKA is a **communication tool**. It helps practitioners communicate movement to each other the way an alphabet communicates speech. The analysis capabilities are secondary to the communicative function.

This is not a criticism of the other systems. Analysis tools are valuable. But they solve a different problem than TKA solves.

## CAPs vs LOOPs: The Precise Comparison

### The Claim: "LOOPs are just CAPs"

This claim is understandable but wrong. Here's why:

**What CAPs do:** Take 2+ elementary patterns, assemble them sequentially, and if the result is cyclic, you have a CAP. The circularity is either discovered empirically or predicted from mathematical parameters.

**What LOOPs do:** Take a TKA word (a sequence of letters), apply a specific transformation (rewound, rotated, mirrored, flipped, swapped, inverted, or compounds thereof), and generate a return path that closes the cycle. The circularity is guaranteed by the transformation, and you only need to learn half (or a quarter) of the pattern.

### Genuine Differences

| Aspect | CAPs | LOOPs |
|---|---|---|
| **How cycles close** | Pattern happens to be cyclic, or math predicts it | Transformation guarantees closure |
| **What you memorize** | The whole repeating unit | Half (or quarter) + transformation type |
| **Vocabulary** | Named moves and mathematical parameters | Letters that spell words |
| **Prop scope** | Primarily poi, adapted to some others | Prop-agnostic by design |
| **Enumeration** | Partially generative (math), partially empirical (discovery) | Fully enumerable per level |
| **Communication** | Requires notation or demonstration | Speakable, writable, textable |
| **Transformation algebra** | No equivalent concept | 6 base types + compound combinations |

### Genuine Similarities

- Both describe cyclic, continuous patterns
- Both involve combining movement fragments into repeating units
- Some specific CAPs and LOOPs produce identical physical movement
- Both serve as frameworks for understanding continuous spinning, not just individual moves
- The broadest CAP definition ("any composite cyclic pattern") overlaps significantly with LOOPs conceptually

### The Honest Take

CAPs and LOOPs address the same human need: describing patterns you can spin forever. They share the territory. But they approach it from opposite directions:

- CAPs come from **analysis** — breaking down observed movement into mathematical components
- LOOPs come from **generation** — applying transformations to produce movement from an alphabet

Neither is "just" a copy of the other. They're different tools that sometimes produce the same output.

## Engaging With Veterans

### When someone says "I know CAPs"

Ask which definition they use:
1. The C-CAP specifically (extension + antispin)?
2. Any C-CAP hand-path combination?
3. The broad "any composite cyclic pattern" definition?

This immediately signals you know the terminology has layers.

### When someone says "LOOPs are just CAPs"

Acknowledge the overlap honestly, then point to the transformation algebra and the speakability. Don't dismiss CAPs — they have genuine mathematical depth (Zaltymbunk's notation, the trigonometric model). But note that TKA's transformation system (rewound, rotated, mirrored + compounds) has no CAP equivalent, and TKA's output is language, not notation.

### When someone brings up VTG

TKA preserves VTG classification data (timing and direction per variation). Show that TKA doesn't replace VTG — it encodes the same information in a form that's speakable. "DJ east-start = split-opp" is stored in TKA's data model.

### When someone references 9-Square Theory

Point to TKA's grid system. Both quantize space. TKA's diamond/box/skewed modes map to 9-Square's grid positions. The parallel is real and worth acknowledging.

### When someone mentions QFT notation

This is the strongest contrast point. QFT notation: `a,b(h(+/-x+/-y+/-z)h'){Class}a',b'`. TKA: "CAKE". Both describe movement precisely. One is writable on a napkin.
