'''Plane bending''' is a [[flow arts]] technique where the prop's spinning [[Plane (flow arts)|plane]] transitions smoothly between orientations (e.g., from wall plane to wheel plane) rather than maintaining a single fixed plane. The result is a curved or tilted path that blends multiple planes.

== Description ==

In standard spinning, the prop traces a circle in a single plane (wall, wheel, or floor). In plane bending, the performer tilts the plane of the prop's rotation during the spin, so the prop's path curves through three-dimensional space rather than staying flat.

The visual effect is a "bending" of the circular path. Instead of a flat circle, the prop traces an arc on the surface of a sphere or [[toroid]].

== Applications ==

* '''Poi''': Plane bending with poi creates smooth transitions between wall plane and wheel plane patterns, or between any two plane orientations
* '''Staff''': Contact staff plane bending involves rolling the staff through multiple planes
* '''Hoops''': Hoop plane bending (sometimes called "lasso" when transitioning to overhead) is a fundamental hoop technique

== Relationship to 3D spinning ==

Plane bending is the gateway to three-dimensional spinning, where the performer intentionally uses all three planes and the transitions between them as part of their practice. The [[Trigonometric model (poi)|trigonometric model]] can describe plane-bent paths by adding a third spatial dimension to the standard 2D equations.

In [[Lorq Nichols|Lorq Nichols']] framework, the three planes (Wall, Horizontal, Floor, abbreviated W/H/F) and their interactions are a core organizational concept.
