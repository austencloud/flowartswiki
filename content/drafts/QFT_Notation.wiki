'''QFT Notation''' ('''Quantized Field Theory Notation''') is a written shorthand system for recording [[poi]] movements, developed by [[Charlie Cushing]]. It breaks continuous poi motion into 8 discrete positions and provides a formula for describing any poi pattern precisely.<ref name="drex-qft">{{cite web |url=https://drexfactor.com/weirdscience/2011/05/18/beginners_guide_poi_qft_notation |title=Beginner's Guide to QFT Notation |publisher=DrexFactor |date=2011-05-18}}</ref>

== System ==

QFT divides the poi's circular path into 8 positions numbered 1 through 8 clockwise, starting from the upper-right (1 = approximately 1:30 on a clock face).

For each increment of movement, the notation tracks:

* Poi departure and arrival positions (1-8)
* Poi direction at each point
* Hand departure and arrival positions
* Hand path radius (measured in poi-length units)

=== Full formula ===

The complete QFT formula for one beat of movement is:

<code>a,b(h(+/-x+/-y+/-z)h'){Class}a',b'</code>

Where:
* '''a, b''' = poi departure positions
* '''h, h'''' = hand departure and arrival positions
* '''+/-x+/-y+/-z''' = direction components
* '''{Class}''' = pattern classification
* '''a', b'''' = poi arrival positions

== Scope ==

QFT can describe any poi pattern, including static spins, [[Extension (flow arts)|extensions]], [[Flower (flow arts)|flowers]], [[Isolation (flow arts)|isolations]], cateyes, triquetras, and [[Continuous Assembly Patterns|CAPs]]. It is technically complete but highly specialized, requiring training to read or write fluently.

== Comparison with other notation ==

QFT and [[The Kinetic Alphabet]] (TKA) both encode precise prop movement. The key difference is output format: QFT produces formulas (<code>a,b(h(+/-x+/-y+/-z)h'){Class}a',b'</code>), while TKA produces speakable words (e.g., "CAKE"). Both can describe the same movements; they differ in readability and communication method.
