A '''tether''' in [[flow arts]] is the connecting element between the performer's hand and the prop head. Tethers are a defining feature of swung props like [[poi]], [[rope dart]], and [[meteor]].

== Types ==

{| class="wikitable"
! Material !! Properties !! Common use
|-
| '''Ball chain''' || Smooth, consistent feel, moderate weight || Practice poi, some performance poi
|-
| '''Cable''' (steel or Dyneema) || Thin profile, lightweight, strong || Fire poi, performance poi
|-
| '''Cord/rope''' (nylon, polyester) || Flexible, lightweight, inexpensive || Practice poi, rope dart
|-
| '''Chain''' (link chain) || Heavy, durable, traditional feel || Fire poi, some traditional Maori poi
|-
| '''Fabric/ribbon''' || Visual effect, lightweight || Silk poi, rhythmic gymnastics crossover
|}

== Length ==

Tether length significantly affects the feel and visual of the prop:

* '''Short tethers''': Faster rotation, more control, smaller patterns. Common in technical/close-range spinning.
* '''Long tethers''': Larger patterns, more visual impact, slower rotation, more difficult to control.
* '''Standard length''': Typically measured from the grip to about the performer's navel, though preferences vary widely.

Tether length affects the [[Trigonometric model (poi)|mathematical relationship]] between hand movement and prop movement, as it determines the minor radius of the [[toroid]] traced by the prop.
