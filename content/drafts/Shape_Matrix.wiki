'''Shape Matrix''' is a visual tool created by [[Lorq Nichols]] that cross-references left-hand and right-hand [[Flower (flow arts)|flower]] patterns in a multiplication-table format. Each cell in the matrix represents a specific [[Hybrid (flow arts)|hybrid]] combination of two flower shapes performed simultaneously.<ref name="shape-matrix">{{cite web |url=http://spinscience.xyz/2016/03/05/shape-matrix-went-poi-chat-viral/ |title=Shape Matrix Went Poi Chat Viral |publisher=Spin Science |date=2016-03-05}}</ref>

== History ==

The Shape Matrix was originally created in 2012, reworked in 2014, and went viral on the Poi Chat community in 2016, receiving 353 shares and 462 likes.<ref name="shape-matrix" />

== Design ==

The matrix is organized as an 8x8 grid where:

* Rows represent the left hand's flower shape
* Columns represent the right hand's flower shape
* Each cell shows the resulting hybrid pattern

This visual format allows spinners to systematically explore all possible two-hand combinations and identify which hybrids they know and which remain to be learned.
