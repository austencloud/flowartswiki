'''Nunchaku''' (also '''nunchucks''' or '''nunchucks''') are a martial arts weapon consisting of two sticks connected by a short chain or rope. In the [[flow arts]] context, nunchaku are used as a manipulation and performance prop.

== Design ==

* '''Sticks''': Two cylindrical sections, typically 25-35 cm each
* '''Connector''': Chain, cord, or rope connecting the two sticks, typically 10-15 cm
* '''Materials''': Wood, foam (for practice), metal, or plastic

== Flow arts nunchaku ==

When used as a flow arts prop, nunchaku techniques emphasize fluid, continuous movement rather than combative strikes:

* '''Passes''': Passing the nunchaku from hand to hand
* '''Rolls''': Rolling the sticks across the body
* '''Spins''': Circular spinning patterns around the hands and body
* '''Aerials''': Tossing and catching
* '''Combinations''': Linking multiple moves into continuous flow

Freestyle nunchaku (sometimes called "artistic nunchaku" or "XMA nunchaku") bridges martial arts and flow arts, focusing on visual performance over combat application.
