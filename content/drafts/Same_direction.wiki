'''Same direction''' is one of the four fundamental [[timing and direction]] relationships in dual-prop [[flow arts]]. When two props rotate in the same direction, both travel clockwise or both travel counterclockwise.

Combined with timing (same or split), same direction yields two of the four basic states:

{| class="wikitable"
! Timing !! Direction !! Combined state !! VTG abbreviation
|-
| [[Same time]] || Same || Same-time same || SS
|-
| [[Split time]] || Same || Split-time same || TS
|}

== In notation systems ==

* '''[[Vulcan Tech Gospel]]''': Same direction is the "S" in SS and TS states. Note: "TS" stands for "Together-Split" in VTG's original terminology, where "together" refers to timing and "split" refers to direction. This can be confusing.
* '''[[The Kinetic Alphabet]]''': Direction is encoded in the specific letter variation
* '''[[QFT Notation]]''': Described through explicit rotation parameters

== Relationship to opposite direction ==

Same direction and [[opposite direction]] are the two direction options. Switching between them constitutes a direction change, one type of [[Transition (flow arts)|transition]].
