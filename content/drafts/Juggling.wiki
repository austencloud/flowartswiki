'''Juggling''' is the physical skill of keeping objects in motion through repeated throwing and catching. It is one of the oldest performing arts, with evidence dating back to ancient Egypt.

== Relationship to flow arts ==

Juggling and [[flow arts]] share historical roots and overlapping communities, though they are generally considered distinct disciplines. Key differences:

* '''Juggling''' emphasizes toss-and-catch patterns with multiple objects in the air simultaneously
* '''Flow arts''' emphasizes continuous manipulation of one or two props, often with an emphasis on body movement and dance

Several props exist in both traditions:
