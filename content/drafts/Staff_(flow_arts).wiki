'''Staff''' is a [[flow arts]] prop consisting of a long rod, typically 4 to 6 feet in length, manipulated through spins, rolls, and contact techniques. Staff can be performed as a single prop or in pairs ([[double staff]]).

Variants include fire staff (with kevlar wicks), LED staff, contact staff (emphasizing body rolls and balances), and dragon staff (a staff with radiating spokes that create additional visual planes).
