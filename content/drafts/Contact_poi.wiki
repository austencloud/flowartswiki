'''Contact poi''' is a style of [[poi]] spinning that emphasizes rolling the poi heads across the body, similar to [[contact juggling]]. Instead of swinging the poi on their tethers at full extension, the performer keeps the poi close to the body and uses the weight of the poi heads to roll along the arms, hands, and torso.

== Description ==

In contact poi, the performer manipulates the poi using direct contact between the poi head and the body, rather than centripetal force through the tether. The poi heads roll across surfaces (arms, palms, back of hands, chest) using gravity and subtle body movements for control.

== Props ==

Contact poi are typically designed differently from standard swinging poi:

* Heavier, rounder heads for smooth rolling
* Shorter or adjustable tethers
* Soft, grippy surface on the head (silicone or rubber)
* Some designs feature a flat "palm" surface for stable balancing

== Techniques ==

* '''Arm rolls''': Rolling the poi along the forearm
* '''Palm spins''': Spinning the poi on the open palm
* '''Stalls''': Stopping the poi on a body surface
* '''Transfers''': Moving the poi from one surface to another
* '''Combined''': Alternating between contact and swinging modes
