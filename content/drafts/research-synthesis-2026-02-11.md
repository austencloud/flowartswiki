## Key Corrections to Existing Articles

1. **VTG started with clubs, not poi.** Source: Noel Yee, Loft Show ep.1. The wiki implies VTG was always a poi system, but Noel developed it while spinning clubs at the Vulcan loft.

2. **PlayPoi did not "popularize VTG/CAPs."** Nick Woolsey's system is independent. Zero mentions of VTG or CAP appear in all 119 PlayPoi transcripts. His pedagogical tradition developed in parallel.

3. **Alien Jon rarely used the term "CAP."** Only 1 mention across 42 transcripts. He taught the constituent mechanics (timing, direction, extension) without using Zaltymbunk's terminology. The wiki over-credits him with promoting the CAP concept.

4. **FireDrums organized by Sky Rockit in 2004.** The wiki incorrectly states Noel Yee co-founded FireDrums. He attended and contributed but was not an organizer.

5. **Zaltymbunk coined the term "Continuous Assembly Pattern."** His own wiki article does not mention this contribution. Needs to be added.

6. **Kinetic_Fire.wiki conflates retreat/event with performance group.** The article merges two distinct entities under one heading without distinguishing them.

7. **9-Square Theory is primarily about flower nomenclature** (lobes, anti-lobes, iso-spin, pro-spin), not just spatial grids. The wiki article under-represents the flower petal counting system that is the core of the theory.

8. **Toroid article ignores Lorq entirely.** Only credits Drexler. Lorq Nichols developed an independent toroid framework connecting toroids to his Four Fundamental Shapes system.

9. **VTG uses "Trivium" (Noel's term), but the wiki says "VTG Trinity" (Drex's term).** Noel Yee's own videos consistently use "Trivium" for the three core parameters. "VTG Trinity" is Drexler's popularization/renaming.

10. **First VTG app built by Kevin (NCK), not Michael Pike.** MCP (Michael Caden Pike) built version 3. Kevin built the original. The wiki credits the wrong person for the initial development.

## Transcript Triage Results

### DrexFactor (324 videos)

- 42 HIGH VALUE (13%): Tech blogs, theory deep dives
- 85 MEDIUM VALUE (26%): Teaching content, 5 Levels series
- 197 LOW VALUE (61%): Performances, vlogs, gear reviews
- **KEY GAP:** Tech blogs #1-129 not captured (only #130 present). These are the densest theory content in the entire pipeline.
- **Top extractable concepts:** toroids, CAPs, flower petal counting, driving styles, cross points

### Lorq Nichols (58 videos)

- Only 3 transcripts have rich spoken content; the rest are music-only demonstrations.
- **Rich transcripts:**
  - Online Clubspinning Workshop
  - Plane-Bending Tutorial
  - TOROIDS VTG.2 Equivalents
- **Key concepts:** Four Fundamental Shapes, 8 Basic Bends, toroid framework, clubs as "static problem" (clubs cannot be momentum-driven the same way poi can)

### Noel Yee (87 videos)

- Approximately 12 substantive transcripts out of 87.
- **Rich transcripts:**
  - Loft Show ep.1 (VTG origin story)
  - NOELTECH#69 (40 patterns demonstrated)
  - VTG App #2 (Snapshots and Trivium explained)
- **Key findings:** 6 named snapshots, 36-square grid, collaborative authorship model, VTG positioned as open source

### Alien Jon (42 videos)

- Approximately 20 workshop recordings are the richest source.
- **Key concepts:** hallway visualization (imagining walls to maintain planes), building blocks framework, snakes as a movement family, 3D space philosophy
- Rarely used "CAP" terminology despite the wiki crediting him with promoting it. Taught the underlying mechanics directly.

### PlayPoi (119 videos)

- Approximately 25 pedagogically rich transcripts from the numbered beginner series.
- **Key concepts:** Poi-Fu (martial arts inspired practice structure), Poitruvian Arms (body position reference system), Jiggies (a movement type), lead-up method, play-first philosophy
- Nick Woolsey's system is independent of VTG. This is a parallel pedagogical tradition, not a derivative.
- Full 50-lesson learning progression reconstructed from transcript analysis.

### SpinMorePoi (7 videos)

- **All 7 are unusable.** Performance clips with music overlays, zero spoken content about 9-Square Theory.
- The 10-part 9-Square Theory series is likely hosted on spinmorepoi.com, not on YouTube. Needs direct website capture.

## New Articles Needed (Priority Order)

1. **History of Flow Arts** - Timeline assembled with 30+ cited sources. No comprehensive history article exists anywhere online.
2. **Poi learning progression** - Synthesized from PlayPoi's 50-lesson sequence and DrexFactor's 5 Levels series.
3. **Poi-Fu / Poitruvian Arms** - Nick Woolsey's pedagogical framework. Original concepts with no existing documentation.
4. **Four Fundamental Shapes (Lorq)** - Core of Lorq's theoretical framework. Not documented anywhere.
5. **8 Basic Bends (Lorq)** - Companion to Four Fundamental Shapes.
6. **Poi therapy / SpinPoi (Dr. Kate Riegle van West)** - First clinical research on poi and health outcomes. Published studies exist.
7. **Flow arts and mental health (ADHD/neurodivergence)** - Growing body of anecdotal and emerging clinical evidence.
8. **Archer weave, Snake (poi), Pulse weave** - Alien Jon techniques documented in workshop transcripts but not on the wiki.
9. **Club spinning** - Major prop with no dedicated article. Lorq's transcripts provide theoretical foundation.
10. **Cross-prop theory** - How concepts transfer between props. Lorq's work is the primary source.
11. **Flow arts festivals overview** - FireDrums, Flow Show, Kinetic Fire, regional burns, etc.
12. **MCP (Michael Caden Pike)** - No article exists. Popularized contact staff, built VTG app v3, built 4+ other flow arts apps, created tutorials.firestaff.net.
13. **Warm-up / injury prevention** - Practical safety content. Multiple YouTube sources available.
14. **Flow arts pedagogy** - Comparing teaching approaches (PlayPoi vs DrexFactor vs Alien Jon vs academic).
15. **Dance vs tech (cultural dynamic)** - The ongoing tension between technical/geometric and dance/expression approaches.

## Article Quality Assessment

- 174 total articles in `content/drafts/`
- 34 redirects
- 140 content articles
- 63 articles (45%) are stubs under 30 lines
- Only 24 articles (17%) are well-developed at 60+ lines
- Approximately 40-50 articles have zero citations

### Strongest articles:
- VTG: 205 lines
- CAPs: 206 lines
- TKA: 225 lines
- Transition Theory: 113 lines

### Weakest articles (core topics with minimal content):
- Poi: 35 lines
- Staff: 15 lines
- Hoops: 18 lines
- Weave: 25 lines

The weakest articles are for the most fundamental topics. Poi, Staff, and Hoops should be among the longest articles on the wiki, not among the shortest.

## Pipeline Expansion Recommendations

### YouTube channels to add

| Channel | Focus | Subscriber count | Notes |
|---------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Hooplovers (Deanne Love) | Hoop | 130K+ | Largest hoop channel |
| Flow Mayhem (Sam) | Rope dart | 31K+ | Primary rope dart source |
| Flowtricks (Ken Hill) | Staff, nunchaku | 30K+ | Staff technique library |
| Daniel Dragonstaff | Dragon staff | 250+ tutorials | Most comprehensive dragon staff source |
| Taylor Tries | Contact juggling | 4.5M views | Largest contact juggling audience |
| Home of Fans (REM) | Fan tutorials | - | Primary fan prop source |
| Jessy Spin | Fire fans, buugeng | - | Fills buugeng gap |
| Sacred Flow Art | Multi-prop | - | Cross-prop content |
| Lux Luminous | Levitation wand | - | Pioneer of the prop |
| Fabio Flowbonacci | Dragon staff | - | Complements Daniel Dragonstaff |
| Rope Dart Academy (Frank Hatsis) | Rope dart | - | Structured curriculum |

### Non-YouTube sources to capture

- **tutorials.firestaff.net** (MCP's staff wiki) - Comprehensive staff reference, directly relevant. May be fragile/unmaintained.
- **Home of Poi lesson library** - 258+ hoop lessons plus other props. Structured curriculum content.
- **flowarts.me** - Best existing multi-prop tutorial index. Good for cross-referencing completeness.
- **Master Flow Arts Skill Trees** - Dragon staff 4-level progression. Structured pedagogical content.
- **Home of Poi forum archives** - Fragile resource, may be partially lost already. Historical discussions, technique debates, community knowledge.

### Missing from current pipeline

- **DrexFactor tech blogs #1-129.** Only #130 is captured. These are the densest theory content in the entire DrexFactor catalog. This is the single biggest gap.
- **SpinMorePoi 9-Square Theory 10-part series.** Likely hosted on spinmorepoi.com rather than YouTube. The 7 YouTube videos are all performance clips.
- **Skylar Garard TKA tutorials.** Channel is configured in the pipeline but has 0 downloads. Needs investigation.

## Citation Policy

Created at `F:\flow-arts-wiki\content\drafts\Flow_Arts_Wiki_Citation_policy.wiki`.

**Key principle:** Primary sources are accepted because almost no academic literature exists on flow arts. The field's knowledge lives in YouTube tutorials, forum posts, workshop recordings, and oral tradition. Requiring only academic sources would make the wiki impossible to write.

**Accepted source types:**
- YouTube videos with timestamps
- Workshop recordings
- Forum posts (with archive links where possible)
- Personal websites of practitioners
- Published academic studies (where they exist)
- Festival programs and event records

**Not accepted:**
- Unattributed claims
- Social media posts without corroboration
- AI-generated summaries without primary source verification

## Open Questions for Future Research

1. Where are SpinMorePoi's 9-Square Theory lessons actually hosted?
2. What happened to DrexFactor tech blogs #1-129? Are they still on YouTube under different titles?
3. Is tutorials.firestaff.net still online and maintained?
4. How much of the Home of Poi forum archive is recoverable?
5. Who were the key figures in the 2005-2008 YouTube tech poi explosion beyond the names we already have?
6. What is the full genealogy of the "toroid" concept? (Charlie Cushing -> Ted Petrovsky -> Drexler -> Lorq, but are there earlier sources?)
7. When exactly did Noel Yee start developing VTG notation? The Loft Show ep.1 gives context but not a precise date.
8. Are there non-English flow arts communities with their own independent theoretical traditions?
