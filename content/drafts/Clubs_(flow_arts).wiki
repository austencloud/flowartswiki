'''Clubs''' in [[flow arts]] are juggling clubs adapted for spinning manipulation. They can be performed singly, in pairs, or in sets of three or more (combining spinning with toss juggling).

Club spinning shares theoretical overlap with other two-prop disciplines. [[Brian Thompson]] taught club spinning [[Hybrid (flow arts)|hybrids]] at the [[Vulcan Lofts]] and co-developed the 24-Hybrid sequence. The [[Vulcan Tech Gospel|VTG]] app supports clubs as a prop type.<ref name="vtg-android">{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.firestaff.mcp.VTGv3&hl=en |title=VTG - Flow Arts Resource |publisher=Google Play}}</ref>
