'''Poi notation''' refers to any system for recording and communicating [[poi]] patterns in written or visual form. Multiple notation systems have been developed, each approaching the problem from a different angle.

== History ==

Early poi knowledge was transmitted primarily through in-person demonstration and video. As the community grew and technique became more complex, several practitioners independently developed notation systems to describe, catalog, and share poi patterns.

== Visual systems ==

In addition to written notation, several visual systems exist:

* [[Tech Tiles]]: Lorq Nichols' tile-based visual notation
* [[Shape Matrix]]: Lorq's multiplication table for hybrids
* TKA pictographs: Visual representations of each letter in The Kinetic Alphabet

== Challenges ==

Poi notation faces several unique challenges:

* '''Three-dimensionality''': Poi moves happen in 3D space but most notation is 2D
* '''Continuous vs discrete''': Poi movement is continuous, but notation must discretize it into beats or states
* '''Multiple simultaneous parameters''': Both hands, both props, timing, direction, plane, body position
* '''Community adoption''': Each system has its own community of users; no single standard has emerged
