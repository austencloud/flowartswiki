'''Opposite direction''' is one of the four fundamental [[timing and direction]] relationships in dual-prop [[flow arts]]. When two props rotate in opposite directions, one travels clockwise while the other travels counterclockwise (or vice versa).

Combined with timing (same or split), opposite direction yields two of the four basic states:

{| class="wikitable"
! Timing !! Direction !! Combined state !! VTG abbreviation
|-
| [[Same time]] || Opposite || Same-time opposite || SO
|-
| [[Split time]] || Opposite || Split-time opposite || TO
|}

== In notation systems ==

* '''[[Vulcan Tech Gospel]]''': Opposite direction is the "O" in SO and TO states
* '''[[The Kinetic Alphabet]]''': Direction is encoded in the specific letter variation
* '''[[QFT Notation]]''': Described through explicit rotation parameters

== Relationship to same direction ==

Opposite direction and same direction are the two direction options. Switching between them constitutes a direction change, one type of [[Transition (flow arts)|transition]].
