The '''Encyclo-poi-dia''' is a reference document for [[poi]] techniques, created by [[Alien Jon]] and [[Zan Moore]]. It catalogs a wide range of poi moves and patterns, serving as an early attempt to comprehensively document the poi trick vocabulary.

== Significance ==

The Encyclo-poi-dia was one of the first efforts to systematically catalog and name poi techniques. It provided a shared vocabulary for the poi community at a time when many moves were known by different names in different regions.

While later theoretical frameworks like the [[Vulcan Tech Gospel]], [[Continuous Assembly Patterns]], and [[The Kinetic Alphabet]] provide more structured systems for describing poi movement, the Encyclo-poi-dia remains a historical reference for the community's trick vocabulary and naming conventions.
