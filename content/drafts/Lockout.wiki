A '''lockout''' is a [[poi]] technique where the performer fully extends their arm, locking the elbow, so that the hand path radius becomes zero and the poi traces a simple circle at the end of the arm. The term describes the locked position of the arm joint.

== Description ==

In a lockout, the arm is held straight and stationary (or nearly so), and the poi swings in a circle determined entirely by the tether length. Because the hand is not tracing its own circle, there is no [[Flower (flow arts)|flower]] pattern and no [[prospin]]/[[antispin]] distinction. The poi simply traces a single circle.

Lockouts are often used as transitional positions or as a starting/ending point for patterns.

== Relationship to other concepts ==

* '''[[Extension (flow arts)|Extension]]''': An extension involves the hand moving in a circle with the prop moving in the same direction. A lockout is the limiting case where the hand circle collapses to a point.
* '''[[Stall]]''': While a stall stops the poi's movement, a lockout stops the hand's movement but the poi continues.
