'''Poi''' are a [[flow arts]] prop consisting of weighted objects attached to flexible cords or chains, swung in circular patterns around the body. Originally a traditional performance art of the Maori people of New Zealand, poi spinning has become one of the most widely practiced forms of flow arts worldwide.

Poi is the prop for which most flow arts theory was developed. The [[Vulcan Tech Gospel]], [[Continuous Assembly Patterns]], [[9-Square Theory]], [[QFT Notation]], [[The Kinetic Alphabet]], and the [[Trigonometric model (poi)|trigonometric model]] all originated from or primarily address poi spinning.

== Variants ==

* '''Practice poi''': Soft, lightweight poi for learning. Often sock poi (a ball in a sock) or beanbag poi.
* '''LED poi''': Battery-powered poi with light elements for night performance.
* '''Fire poi''': Poi with kevlar wicks that are lit for fire performance.
* '''Contact poi''': Shorter poi designed for body contact techniques.
* '''Pixel poi''': Programmable LED poi that display images and patterns when spun (persistence of vision).

== Theory ==

Poi is the most theoretically developed prop in flow arts. Key frameworks include:

* [[Timing and direction]]: The foundational variables for all two-prop spinning.
* [[Vulcan Tech Gospel]]: Classification of timing, direction, snapshots, and pattern shapes.
* [[Continuous Assembly Patterns]]: Compositional technique for assembling pattern fragments.
* [[Trigonometric model (poi)|Trigonometric model]]: Parametric equations describing all poi patterns.
* [[The Kinetic Alphabet]]: Letter-based notation for two-handed manipulation.
