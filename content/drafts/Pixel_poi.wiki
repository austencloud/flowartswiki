'''Pixel poi''' are a type of [[LED props|LED poi]] containing strips of individually addressable LEDs that can display images, text, and complex color patterns using [[persistence of vision]] (POV). When spun, the rapid movement of the LED strip combined with precisely timed color changes creates the illusion of a complete image floating in the air.

== How it works ==

A pixel poi contains:

* A strip of addressable LEDs (typically 30-100 LEDs per strip)
* A microcontroller that controls each LED's color independently
* An accelerometer or gyroscope to detect the poi's angular position
* Software that maps image data to LED output based on the current angle of rotation

As the poi spins, the microcontroller changes each LED's color hundreds of times per second. Because the poi makes a full revolution faster than the eye can process, the brain blends all the color changes into a single circular image.

== Capabilities ==

* '''Static images''': Photographs, logos, text displayed as floating circles
* '''Animations''': Frame-by-frame animation displayed over multiple revolutions
* '''Live patterns''': Algorithmically generated color patterns that respond to speed or music
* '''Custom programming''': Users can upload their own images and sequences

== Notable products ==

* '''Flowtoys Capsule''': Modular pixel system by [[Flowtoys]]
* Various custom and open-source pixel poi projects
