A '''meteor''' (also '''meteor hammer''' or '''rope meteor''') is a [[flow arts]] and martial arts prop consisting of weights on both ends of a rope or cord. Unlike [[poi]], which uses two separate props, a meteor is a single continuous prop with a weight at each end.

== Design ==

A standard meteor consists of:

* '''Rope or cord''': Typically 150-250 cm in length
* '''Weights''': Attached at both ends, which can be soft balls, contact balls, fire wicks, or LED units
* '''Balance point''': The rope is typically held or draped near its center

Variants include:
* '''Contact meteor''': Soft-bodied weights designed for body contact and rolls
* '''Fire meteor''': Kevlar wicks on both ends for [[fire spinning]]
* '''LED meteor''': LED pods on both ends
* '''Oxbow meteor''': A curved-handle variant developed and popularized by [[Charlie Cushing]] of Lanternsmith, manufactured by Flowtoys<ref name="flowtoys-oxbow">{{cite web |url=https://flowtoys.com/oxbow |title=Oxbow |publisher=Flowtoys}}</ref>

== Techniques ==

Meteor manipulation combines elements of [[poi]], [[staff (flow arts)|staff]], and [[rope dart]]:

* '''Spinning''': Circular patterns with one or both ends
* '''Wraps''': Wrapping the rope around the body or limbs
* '''Stalls''': Catching or stopping one end while the other continues
* '''Contact''': Rolling the weights across the body
* '''Throws''': Releasing one or both ends and catching
