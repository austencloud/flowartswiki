'''Fire fans''' (also called '''flow fans''') are a [[flow arts]] prop consisting of rigid or folding fan structures, often with kevlar wicks for fire performance or LED elements for light performance. They are typically performed in pairs.

[[Vulcan Tech Gospel|VTG]] concepts apply to fire fans. Mike Smith ("Doodle") adapted VTG for fans as "Fan VTG 1:1."
