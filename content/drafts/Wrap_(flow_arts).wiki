A '''wrap''' in [[flow arts]] is a technique where the prop wraps around a body part (arm, leg, neck, waist) and then unwraps to continue spinning. Wraps use the prop's momentum and the body part as a pivot point to redirect the prop's path.

Wraps are common across multiple prop types including [[poi]], [[staff (flow arts)|staff]], and rope dart. They add texture and variety to spinning sequences and can serve as transitions between patterns.
