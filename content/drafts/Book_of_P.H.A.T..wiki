The '''Book of P.H.A.T.''' is a reference document for [[flow arts]] pattern classification created by [[Lorq Nichols]] with contributions from [[Brian Thompson]], [[David Cantor|David "Tankboy" Cantor]], and [[Noel Yee]]. '''P.H.A.T.''' stands for "'''P'''atterns, '''H'''ybrids, '''A'''nd '''T'''ransitions."<ref name="phat">{{cite web |url=https://sirlorq.wordpress.com/tech-tiles/ |title=Vulcan Tech Gospel Book of P.H.A.T. Volume 1 |publisher=Sir Lorq}}</ref>

== Contents ==

The book is divided into two parts:

* '''Part 1: Manual to Understand''': Theory covering position/rotation, hand and prop positioning, static spin, [[driving style|driving styles]], and [[timing and direction]].
* '''Part 2: 64 Patterns in [[Tech Tiles]]''': Visual demonstrations of all 64 patterns in the [[Vulcan Tech Gospel|VTG]] 1:3 ratio set (four-petal [[antispin]] [[Flower (flow arts)|flowers]]), organized in an 8x8 grid and color-coded pink for left hand and cyan for right hand.<ref name="phat" />

== Significance ==

The Book of P.H.A.T. extends the [[Vulcan Tech Gospel]]'s pattern catalog from the 1:1 ratio set (40 patterns, documented by [[Noel Yee]]) into the 1:3 ratio set (64 patterns). It uses the [[Tech Tiles]] visualization system to present each pattern, making the full four-petal antispin flower catalog visually accessible.
