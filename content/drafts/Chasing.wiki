'''Chasing''' is a [[poi]] pattern where one poi follows the path of the other, maintaining a consistent angular gap between them. Both poi trace the same circular path but are offset in phase, creating the visual effect of one "chasing" the other.

== Description ==

In chasing patterns, both poi travel in the same direction along the same circular path. The distance (in degrees of rotation) between the two poi remains constant. Common phase offsets include:

* '''Close chase''': Small angular gap between the two poi
* '''Half chase''': 180-degree gap (equivalent to [[split time]] when viewed from the side)
* '''Quarter chase''': 90-degree gap

== Relationship to timing ==

Chasing is closely related to the concept of [[timing and direction]]. A chase with a 180-degree offset is visually identical to split-time same-direction spinning when viewed from certain angles.
