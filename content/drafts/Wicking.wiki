'''Wicking''' refers to the kevlar (aramid fiber) material used on [[fire spinning]] props to absorb and hold fuel for combustion. Wicking is a critical component of any fire prop, determining burn time, flame size, and safety characteristics.

== Materials ==

=== Kevlar (aramid fiber) ===

The standard wicking material for fire props. Kevlar is chosen for its:

* '''Heat resistance''': Does not melt or burn under normal fire spinning conditions
* '''Fuel absorption''': Holds fuel well, providing consistent burn
* '''Durability''': Lasts through many burns before degrading
* '''Availability''': Sold in rolls by fire prop manufacturers

Kevlar wicking is available in several forms:
* '''Flat wick''': Sheet kevlar, used for wrapping around prop heads and edges
* '''Rope wick''': Braided or twisted kevlar cord, used for cathedral-style wicks and wrapped heads
* '''Knit wick''': Tubular knit kevlar, used for stuffing and padding

=== Other materials ===

* '''Fiberglass''': Sometimes used as a base layer under kevlar
* '''Cotton''': Used historically but inferior to kevlar in durability and heat resistance. Cotton burns away over time.

== Wick types ==

{| class="wikitable"
! Type !! Description !! Common on
|-
| '''Cathedral wick''' || Loops of kevlar rope radiating from a central bolt || Poi, staff ends
|-
| '''Wrapped wick''' || Flat kevlar wrapped tightly around a frame || Fire fans, hoop spines
|-
| '''Roll wick''' || Flat kevlar rolled into a cylinder || Staff ends, poi
|-
| '''Rope head''' || Kevlar rope knotted into a ball || Rope dart
|}

== Maintenance ==

* Wicks should be inspected regularly for fraying, loose wraps, or bolt loosening
* Fuel residue builds up over time and can be burned off
* Wicks have a finite lifespan (typically hundreds of burns) and should be replaced when they begin to deteriorate
* New wicks should be "broken in" with a few burns before extended use
