An '''isopop''' (short for '''isolation pop''') is a [[poi]] technique combining an [[Isolation (flow arts)|isolation]] with a sudden directional change. The poi maintains an apparent fixed position in space (isolation) and then "pops" to a new position by reversing direction or shifting to a new spatial anchor point.

== Description ==

During an isopop, the performer holds the poi in an isolation (the poi head appears stationary while the hand orbits around it), then rapidly transitions to a new isolation at a different spatial point. The "pop" is the visible jump from one fixed point to another.

The technique requires precise control of both the isolation (keeping the poi visually stationary) and the transition (the brief moment of movement between positions).
