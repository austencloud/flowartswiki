A '''contact roll''' is a [[flow arts]] technique where a prop is rolled across the surface of the body (arms, chest, back, legs) while maintaining continuous contact. Contact rolling is used with [[staff (flow arts)|staff]], [[Hoops|hoops]], and other rigid props.

== Description ==

During a contact roll, the prop moves across the body without being gripped. The performer guides the prop's path using body positioning, angles, and subtle movements. Gravity and momentum keep the prop in motion.

Common contact roll paths include:

* '''Arm roll''': Across the forearm, over the elbow, and along the upper arm
* '''Chest roll''': Across the chest from one arm to the other
* '''Back roll''': Across the upper back and shoulders
* '''Neck roll''': Around the back of the neck
* '''Leg roll''': Along the thigh (typically with hoops)

== Props ==

Contact rolling is most commonly associated with:

* '''[[Staff (flow arts)|Staff]]''': The most common prop for contact rolling due to its length and cylindrical shape
* '''[[Hoops]]''': Hoop contact work includes on-body rolls and lifts
* '''[[Contact juggling]]''': Ball contact is a specialized discipline in itself

== Related concepts ==

Contact rolling is distinct from [[Wrap (flow arts)|wraps]] (where the prop's tether wraps around the body) and from [[Isolation (flow arts)|isolations]] (where the prop appears stationary). Contact rolls involve the prop physically traveling across the body surface.
