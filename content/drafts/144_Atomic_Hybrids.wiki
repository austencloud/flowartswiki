The '''144 Atomic Hybrids''' is a classification system developed by [[Lorq Nichols]] that catalogs 144 distinct [[Hybrid (flow arts)|hybrid]] poi patterns where the two poi perform different [[Atomic (flow arts)|atomic]]-style movements simultaneously.

== Structure ==

=== 12 single-poi behaviors ===

The system begins with the observation that a single poi has exactly 12 possible behaviors, derived from 4 fundamental shapes performed in 3 [[Plane (flow arts)|planes]]:<ref name="144-hybrids">{{cite web |url=https://sirlorq.wordpress.com/144ultimatepattern/ |title=144 Atomic Hybrids |publisher=Sir Lorq}}</ref>

* 4 shapes: [[Extension (flow arts)|Extension]], [[Isolation (flow arts)|Isolation]], 2VA (2-beat vertical [[antispin]]), 2HA (2-beat horizontal antispin)
* 3 planes: wall, wheel, floor

4 shapes x 3 planes = 12 single-poi behaviors.

=== Combining two poi ===

The 144 patterns result from assigning any of the 12 behaviors to the left poi and any of the 12 behaviors to the right poi:

* 12 left-poi behaviors x 12 right-poi behaviors = 144 combinations
* Some combinations are symmetric (same behavior on both sides), while most are asymmetric [[Hybrid (flow arts)|hybrids]]

=== The quarter-pattern principle ===

Nichols identifies a structural property of these patterns: knowing one quarter of a pattern is sufficient to reconstruct the entire pattern. This holds because each pattern has rotational symmetry -- the four quadrants of the pattern repeat the same spatial relationships, rotated by 90 degrees. A spinner who can execute one quarter of an atomic hybrid can deduce the remaining three quarters from that fragment.<ref name="144" />

== Relationship to other frameworks ==

The 144 Atomic Hybrids system is one of several classification frameworks developed by [[Lorq Nichols]]:

* [[Shape Matrix]]: An 8x8 matrix for hybrid patterns
* [[Book of P.H.A.T.]]: 64 core patterns
* [[324 Patterns]]: 27 arm paths x 12 shapes

These frameworks overlap and intersect, each organizing the same space of possible movements from a different angle.
