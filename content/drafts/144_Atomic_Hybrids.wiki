The '''144 Atomic Hybrids''' is a classification system developed by [[Lorq Nichols]] that catalogs 144 distinct [[Hybrid (flow arts)|hybrid]] poi patterns where the two poi perform different [[Atomic (flow arts)|atomic]]-style movements simultaneously.

== Structure ==

The 144 patterns are derived from combining 12 possible single-poi behaviors with each other:

* 12 possibilities for the left poi x 12 possibilities for the right poi = 144 combinations
* Some combinations are symmetric (same pattern on both sides), while most are asymmetric

== Relationship to other frameworks ==

The 144 Atomic Hybrids system is one of several classification frameworks developed by [[Lorq Nichols]]:

* [[Shape Matrix]]: An 8x8 matrix for hybrid patterns
* [[Book of P.H.A.T.]]: 64 core patterns
* [[324 Patterns]]: 27 arm paths x 12 shapes

These frameworks overlap and intersect, each organizing the same space of possible movements from a different angle.
