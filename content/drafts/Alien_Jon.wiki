== Contributions ==

=== Arcs and loops ===

Alien Jon articulated the distinction between '''arcs''' and '''loops''' in poi paths, concepts later formalized in [[Transition Theory]]:<ref name="drex-transition">{{cite web |url=https://drexfactor.com/weirdscience/2010/09/29/soft_hard_and_mixed_transition_theory |title=Soft, Hard, and Mixed Transition Theory |publisher=DrexFactor |date=2010-09-29}}</ref>

* '''Loops''': Sections where the poi and hand paths intersect ([[antispin]] petals, [[prospin|inspin]] petals, [[Isolation (flow arts)|isolations]]).
* '''Arcs''': Sections where hand and poi paths run parallel without intersecting ([[Extension (flow arts)|extensions]]).

This distinction became foundational to understanding how the [[Continuous Assembly Patterns|C-CAP]] mechanism converts between pattern types.

=== CAP promotion ===

Alien Jon adopted and promoted the [[Continuous Assembly Patterns|Continuous Assembly Pattern]] concept originally coined by Damien (Zaltymbunk) on the [[Home of Poi]] forums. His performance work demonstrated the technique's potential and helped establish CAPs as a core element of technical spinning vocabulary.<ref name="hop-caps">{{cite web |url=https://www.homeofpoi.com/en/community/forums/topics/891193/What-are-CAP-s |title=What are CAPs? |publisher=Home of Poi Forums}}</ref>

=== Encyclo-poi-dia ===

Co-created with [[Zan Moore]], the ''Encyclo-poi-dia Volume 2'' is a 22-chapter, 95-minute instructional DVD covering advanced poi techniques including CAPs.<ref name="encyclopoidia" />
